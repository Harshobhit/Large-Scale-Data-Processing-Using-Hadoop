# Large-Scale-Data-Processing-Using-Hadoop
In this repository I am going to list some simple experiments on using Hadoop on local system(Ubuntu 16.04 lts).
The main requirements for the experiments are:-
1)Hadoop VM(Which is provided in the repository).
2)Basic Hadoop Commands
3)Preferrably Eclipse IDE(For Java Programs) and easy creation of Jar Files.
